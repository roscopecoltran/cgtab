"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"

## TODO

*   test how fast a git repository works with binary files, git clone --depth 1 is maybe suitable 
*   split binary files and thirdparty libs in seperate git repository, cmake should then test if the repositorys have the right version
*   very big files could be stored on local storage, cmake could then test diffrent sources for the repository
